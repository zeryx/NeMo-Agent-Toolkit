Alert Triage HTTP Server

This script implements a Flask-based HTTP server that automates alert triage workflows.
It provides an endpoint that:
1. Accepts POST requests containing monitoring alerts in JSON format
2. Collects alert IDs to track all processed alerts
3. Launches a NAT triage agent for each unique alert
4. The triage agent performs automated investigation using diagnostic tools
   and generates structured reports with root cause analysis

The server acts as the entry point for the alert triage system, enabling automated
handling of monitoring alerts from various sources.

Example Usage:

1. Start the server:
   python run.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --env_file /path/to/.env

2. Send a single alert (in a separate terminal):
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/alerts \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
        "alert_id": 1,
        "alert_name": "InstanceDown",
        "host_id": "test-instance-1.example.com",
        "severity": "critical",
        "description": "Instance test-instance-1.example.com is not available for scrapping for the last 5m. " \
                      "Please check: - instance is up and running; - monitoring service is in place and running; " \
                      "- network connectivity is ok",
        "summary": "Instance test-instance-1.example.com is down",
        "timestamp": "2025-04-28T05:00:00.000000"
     }'

3. Send multiple alerts (in a separate terminal):
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/alerts \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[{
        "alert_id": 1,
        "alert_name": "InstanceDown",
        "host_id": "test-instance-1.example.com",
        "severity": "critical",
        "description": "Instance test-instance-1.example.com is not available for scrapping for the last 5m. " \
                      "Please check: - instance is up and running; - monitoring service is in place and running; " \
                      "- network connectivity is ok",
        "summary": "Instance test-instance-1.example.com is down",
        "timestamp": "2025-04-28T05:00:00.000000"
     }, {
        "alert_id": 2,
        "alert_name": "CPUUsageHighError",
        "host_id": "test-instance-2.example.com",
        "severity": "critical",
        "description": "CPU Overall usage on test-instance-2.example.com is high ( current value 100% ). " \
                      "Please check: - trend of cpu usage for all cpus; - running processes for investigate issue; " \
                      "- is there any hardware related issues (e.g. IO bottleneck)",
        "summary": "CPU Usage on test-instance-2.example.com is high (error state)",
        "timestamp": "2025-04-28T06:00:00.000000"
     }]'

Response format:
{
    "received_alert_count": 2,  // number of alerts received in the latest request
    "total_launched": 5  // cumulative count of all alerts processed
}
